Looking over [the selection of Firefox buttons](http://spreadfirefox.com/community/?q=affiliates/homepage) at the new [SpreadFirefox](http://spreadfirefox.com) site, I was inspired to make this:

[![Get Fiberfox!](fiberfox-Jd1xqfvXFQlv.png)](http://getfirefox.com)

To the obvious question, I say: Why not? This is an audience participation blog post. Warm up your Photoshops and your MacPaints and lets see your take on the little browser that could!

**UPDATE:** This comes from Scott @ [techory.com](http://techory.com):

![Get Tirefox - All season browser](gettire-Usr3RbELn1QE.jpg)

He has another one [on his blog](http://techory.com/blog/index.php?p=44). Cool stuff!

**UPDATE 2:** Daniel Keep sent this one through email. Thanks Daniel ðŸ™‚
