I’m really digging the album “[Give](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playListId=5503203 "This is a link to Give in the iTunes Music Store")” by [The Bad Plus](http://www.thebadplus.com/). It’s jazz with a sort of punk vibe. Sometimes cacophonous, often experimental and always interesting. They even do a cover of one of my favorite [Pixies](http://www.4ad.com/artists/catalogue/pixies/) songs.

> Oh nice! didn't know their new one was out. I have been loving their 'These Are The Vistas' album lately.

> I have just seen the Bad Plus live a few weeks ago at Philadelphia Kimmel Center where they did their cover of Velouria hearing them do it live was even more powerful then the recorded version.
> If you ever get a chance to hear them live go for it!
