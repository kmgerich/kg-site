The birds have been returning to New England over the past month. From my porch I can see jays, crows, robins, cardinals, and I can hear the occasional woodpecker. Over the past few years, in late March or early April, a single bird, an american robin I think, sits in a tree outside our window and sings its little lungs out in the early morning. It’s a strange thing to hear because there is almost no other bird chatter at that time. My girlfriend and I call this the “4:30 birdie”. Spring may have sprung, but the season won’t have truly changed until the 4:30 birdie arrives.

> If the song is really complicated, long, and repetitive, it might be a mockingbird.

> They're neat. I love watching one chase after a much larger crow, yelling at it and even touching the crow when it can.
