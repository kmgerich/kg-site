![](firefox64-pMezkzHxC8HC.png)New Name. New Look. New Icon. The program formerly known as Phoenix and Mozilla Firebird has [just released version 0.8](http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=4278). This version is faster and more stable than before and has more neat features than you can shake a stick at. Check the [release notes](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/). It also features the [Pinstripe theme](http://kmgerich.com/archive/000049.html) as the new default look on Mac OS X. [Download it here](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/)!

![](firebird-toolbar-eXlmKHYOUzza.png)

Note: The Firefox UI may appear broken if you are using a previous version of the Pinstripe theme. Go into your theme preferences, select “Firefox (default)”, then close and reopen the browser to make sure you are using the latest incarnation of the Pinstripe theme.

> To be honest, I'm not wild about the name change either, but I don't think it's actually a bad choice. I've certainly seen <a href="http://mozillazine.org/poll_results.html?id=2960" rel="nofollow ugc">worse names suggested</a>. Give it some time to sink in.

**Noah** on 2004-02-10 00:32:24
> That white box has been with us since the earliest of Mozilla... If I remember right, since the Mac is the only platform where all windows run under a single application instance, that control window keeps Firefox running when no browser windows are open, unlike Windows and 'nix, where each window is an application thread. It also keeps the menu bar going since on the other platforms menus are bound to the windows themselves. They got good at hiding that lil' guy (it used to appear in the Dock's window list) but obviously Expose has made it visible once again.

> Try <a href="http://www.intraplanar.net/projects/tabprefs/" rel="nofollow ugc">TabPrefs 0.5</a>. Works fine w/ FF0.8 and comes with less fluff than TBE.

**Paul** on 2004-02-10 17:21:53
> Noah - Thanks for the explanation about the white box.

> Carlo - I tried TabPrefs but new windows are still created by external apps, not new tabs. I have to use Safari with NetNewsWire for now I guess.

**phil** on 2004-02-12 14:01:00
> I think Firefox is a fine name, especially given the  paucity of options.  It has a pretty good pedigree (originally famous for being a bestselling book about a wicked-cool plane of some kind) that was made into a Clint movie.

**amake** on 2004-02-13 02:17:13
> To get Firefox to open external URLs in the current window, go to about:config and set "browser.always_reuse_window" to true.

> Unfortunately, this doesn't open a new tab.  Maybe you can get your desired effect with a combination of this and TabPrefs.

> A few surprizes in Firefox .8 on my Jaguar G4:

> 1-The theme preview in the preferences window showed a very old classic theme when I picked 'default'. Fortunately, the new pinstripe theme actually appeared on the browser.

> 2-The icon on all alerts is the old phoenix icon!

> 3-There is no way to launch the venkman extension, and the autoforms extension completely disappeared.

> A while ago I did <a href="http://kmgerich.com/archive/000015.html" rel="nofollow ugc">an experiment to turn Phoenix metal</a>. It had horrible redraw issues where parts of the interface would just dissapear. I'm sure that if you use a brushed metal OS theme, Firefox will look ugly because while the theme attempts to use the OS theme, in some places I have to cheat because the OS theme doesn't provide things that I'd like to do.
> 
> For instance the API for applying OS theme styles will only give me a darker toolbar background, not the lighter one as seen in Cocoa apps. So I use a semi-transparent white PNG over the OS-drawn toolbar backgroundand they blend to give the desired look. This means that the Firefox toolbar looks like a Cocoa one when you use the default OS theme. But if you switch to a different one, particularly one with a dark toolbar background, you'll see that the Firefox toolbar is slightly lighter than the rest of the theme colors.

> monoclast, sorry that it's taking so long. But the Mozilla Suite theme is still in the works, and is in fact closer to being done now that we're almost finished with the Thunderbird theme, so "soon" still applies :)

**Fingerprint** on 2004-04-22 09:37:09
> To (Someone): I undersood it. But I'm amazed, because the Pinstripe looks good (excellent) also under WinXP default theme. Without porting.
