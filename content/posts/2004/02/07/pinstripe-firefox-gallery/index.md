The newly released Mozilla Firefox 0.8 has a new look on Mac OS X. It is the first Firefox milestone to be released with the Pinstripe theme as the default. Here are a few screen shots.

Screen shots of Firefox on Windows can be found at [Neilâ€™s World](http://www.neilturner.me.uk/2004/Feb/09/firefox_screenshots.html).

> These theme makes firebird more aqua looking than camino, it's so elegant, ive been using it since the firstnightlies it is a great work... i was wondering if your you are going to develop a mozilla one??
> 
> The only thing thats missing from totally turning me to FB its that there is no close button per tab ala Safari...

**Kevin** on 2004-02-08 08:41:53
> Thanks for the compliment Mario :) Yes I am going to be making a Mozilla Suite theme after I announce the Thunderbird theme which should be in the next week or two.

> Thanks again for your Pinstripe themes... As a Mozilla suite fan, I'm waiting (for a long time now !!! :)) your version for 1.6 and next... firebird is nice, but a little bit too much rough on mac for the moment... And the suite app. is almost perfect !!!
> Thanks again !

**Peter** on 2004-02-08 15:24:42

**rgw** on 2004-02-08 17:26:25
> I'm no Mac user, but wouldn't the customize toolbar dialog be better displayed as one of those spiffy 'sheets' instead of a dialog window. That seems to be the UI rule concerning dialog boxes on teh mac.

**Kevin** on 2004-02-08 19:35:02
> You're right rgw. Here's the <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206649" rel="nofollow ugc">bug report</a> that covers it. This is one of the rough spots which will hopefully be smoothed out by Firebird 1.0

**rgw** on 2004-02-08 20:34:15
> Thanks for the info Kevin! BTW, your theme looks very classy; definitely makes firebird look 'purdy' on the mac.

**Brad** on 2004-02-09 00:39:49

**leonard** on 2004-02-09 04:58:59

**Joel** on 2004-02-09 16:28:10
> The theme is gorgeous. Looking forward to the app. suite version. It's the only reason I've been hanging on to Mozilla 1.4.1.

**Martin** on 2004-02-09 18:46:21

**Minh Nguye&#x1ec5;n** on 2004-02-09 20:07:02

**Rodion** on 2004-02-09 20:35:27

**pantz** on 2004-02-09 22:03:38
> This one is for Mario - the guy who posted first - you can have close buttons for each tab in Fire[bird|fox]. You just have to install the 'Tabbrowser' extension - and it is in there amongst the many other cool options this gives ...
> 
> eg. you can shuffle the order of tabs, you can recall recently closed tabs, you can change color o f active tab, oh the list is so long my fingers just fell of

**Sadalsuud** on 2004-02-09 23:43:40
> The tabs look great but the buttons are ugly and the favorites bar looks like the appalling Safari ! I hope you'll deliver an alternative with colorful buttons. Nice work nevertheless. Congratulations.

**Jamp** on 2004-02-10 00:40:49
> I agree. Please bring back the old default theme. This new one is ugly. How one can design so horrible widgets is a mystery. Keep it for you if you want but the problem is that I can't find how to recover the old default theme who was perfect. Please help.

**Josh S** on 2004-02-10 10:39:28

**Jamp** on 2004-02-10 13:47:21
> You're right. But why to be grateful for something I don't like ? I suppose you can't understand that someone don't like this theme but it's not a criticism of your work. Technically the execution is perfect. I just don't like these ugly widgets. Personnaly, I can't understand you like it. Thanks for your efforts nevertheless.

**Riccardo** on 2004-02-10 19:42:02
> Great work, this theme is awesome!!
> 
> The only thing I would object to is the scissor icon you chose for "cut" button, which is visually unrelated with "copy" and "paste" ones - please don't blame me for addressing such a trivial point... :-)
> 
> Slighty off-topic, my 2 cents on the issue of  "Close tab" button location addressed by Mario: although Apple's choice brings the benefit of letting you close backgrounded tabs quickly, I think that from an UI standpoint Mozilla's solution is preferable because enhances spatial consistency.

**YumYum** on 2004-02-10 19:43:35
> I've been using firebird 0.8, err -fox, since the january nightlies and like it better than Safari. It's rock solid and fast and renders almost everything you throw at it. And with Firefox-pinstripe a great browser got great looks! I love it. Lean and mean ;-) Thanks for getting all the icons done so well. I'm still amazed by the robustness of firefox and pinstripe. (I like firefox-pinstripe better than the old mozilla-pinstripe 2.0.) Thanks Kevin!!!

**Jozer99** on 2004-02-10 20:35:27
> Port this to Windows, you know someone is going to do it anyway, you might as well do it right.

**Laurence Gonsalves** on 2004-02-11 00:00:35
> Riccardo: what do you mean by "enhances spatial consistency"? I honestly can't figure out what that's supposed to mean. To me, having a single "close current tab" button makes about as much sense as having a single "close current window" button in the corner of my screen.
> 
> One of the main things preventing me from switching to Firefox is the clunkiness of the tabs compared to Galeon. Every time a new version comes out I give it another chance. I've also tried using "Tabbrowser extensions", but Galeon still has significantly better tabbed browsing support, IMHO. Galeon lets me have:
> 
> <ul><li> tabs at the bottom (makes mores sense to me for some reason). Tabbrowser extensions lets you turn this on, but the tabs still render like they're supposed to be on the top. :-Q
> 
> <li>close buttons on the tabs. Again, Tabbrowser extensions lets you turn this on, but the close buttons it uses are ENORMOUS. The close buttons on my Firefox tabs are about 1/3 the size of an entire tab in Galeon.
> 
> <li>closing the last tab closes the window. This seems like the most obvious thing, but I can't get this in Firefox even with Tabbrowser extensions!
> 
> <li>can drag tabs off of a window. If I want a tab to be in its own window in Galeon I can just drag it off.
> 
> <li>Galeon seems to be a lot smarter about where it opens tabs. It also remembers which tabs I've looked at, and which I haven't, and color codes them.
> 
> <li>sensible options without having to install a separate extension that pops up big ugly dialogs and makes my browser unstable (I get a lot more crashes and bizarre rendering artifacts when Tabbrowser extensions is installed)
> </li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>

**Thomas** on 2004-02-11 01:59:49
> Hey, I installed Firefox on a OS X 10.1 machine I had lying around. However, I noticed that the default theme is different from the one show in the screen shots at the top of this page. Unlike the screen shot pics, my Firefox doesn't have that new smoothe 10.3 Panther look to it. I still see the horizonal lines all over the interface. Is this normal? Is the Firefox/Pinstripe theme supposed to look different depending on the OS it's running on?

**Chris Hester** on 2004-02-11 07:55:55

**Riccardo** on 2004-02-11 12:15:36
> Laurence, I was referring to a "good rule" in interface design, which says that buttons and controls should always, as far as possible, keep the very same position on screen. This is intended to help users automate the mental process required to target the active area of the control ("muscle memory"), thus letting them gain confidence and efficency when operating the interface. In general, Mozilla close tab button keeps the very same relative position in the browser's windows. Speaking of my personal habits, I also find this very comfortable when I'm on Windows OSes: I'm used to keep all windows maximized to full screen, and in this special case, the close tab button maintain the same absolute position on screen. I istintictively konw that I have to move to the upper left side of the screen to hit the button - and, by the way, I also have not to worry about bringing another tab to the front if I "mistarget" the button's active area.
> 
> Anyway, I can admit that those could not be such strong points when it comes to different users' behaviors, and when compared to other advantages carried by having close buttons on each tab.
> 
> Also, I'm not sure, really, if "spatial consistency" is the right term for this thing - I'm italian and my english is a bit rough, beg your pardon :-)

> Cheers

**Andrew** on 2004-02-11 19:14:59

> :( oh well...
> Keep up the good work! (and port this theme to windows!)

**Nate** on 2004-02-11 22:25:23
> PLEASE PLEASE LET'S HAVE A WINDOWS VERSION!

**Matt** on 2004-02-14 18:57:30
> Stop asking for Windows ports.  This isn't as simple as you may imagine.  Yes, most themes work fine on any OS version of Firefox, but Pinstripe isn't like most themes.
> 
> Pinstripe actually makes use of the GUI libraries on OSX to make it look that way.  There's no way to simply port these libraries to Windows, so Pinstripe can't simply be ported to Windows.  Yes, someone could make a theme that looks nearly identical to Pinstripe, but it's not really reasonable to ask this guy to maintain two themes that look the same just so people on Windows can use this.
> 
> If you really want this look you have a couple options:
> - Write your own theme that looks like this
> - Get one of the theme programs for Windows (not a complete solution, but similar)
> - Get a Mac.  If you like the look so much, why not actually get a Mac and forget about Windows.

Be warned, it can cause some serious damage if not installed properly: Close FireFox, backup the old classic.jar file in 'Mozilla FireFox/chrome' and replace it with this. Some extensions may cause serious issues with this theme.

**Dave** on 2004-02-16 11:01:30
> Just got Firefox (what an improvement from 0.7!) & I do like the new version of Pinstripe very much.  Still, sometimes one wants buttons with pretty colors too!  Any chance you might port the last version of Pinstripe over for Firefox as an alternate for us to use?  Or perhaps color this one in with colors to match the buttons you used in the Bookmark manager?  I think you were going for the Apple plastic button look, which is cool, but as I said, sometimes one wants pretty colors!

> the theme is absolutely gorgeous. beautifully safari-esque. you need to make it for windows because I love safari but I can only use that at school and the closest thing I cna get at home is using firefox on windows.

**chimerical** on 2004-03-06 18:53:16
> This theme is absolutely stunning.  I love it.

> Regarding the Windows port...
> (The Windows port [classic.jar above] has some problems with the Privacy and Advanced sections under Options.  The [+] boxes are missing.  And the 'Save All Files to Folder' dropbox under the Downloads section under Options is a bit large on the height side.  And the navigation toolbar has a bit too much space above and below the buttons.  But don't get me wrong.  It's a GREAT port, and I appreciate all the work put into it.)

**george** on 2004-03-25 03:41:17
> i think windows users should use their own themes that they have access too, theres only like THREE themes that work ok on mac (including pinstripe), but yet so many users would rather use the themes that were MAC ONLY than their own...

**mike** on 2004-03-28 07:24:45
> Very nice. The only problem--and it's probably not a theme problem--are the big, ugly, jagged form entry areas and submit buttons. Why isn't Firemonkey (or whatever the name is today) using the same form items that Safari is?

**Tony** on 2004-04-01 20:18:23
> My only problem, and it keeps me using Safari most of the time, is that the drop-down list of bookmarks is so narrow in Firefox that I cannot tell which bookmark is what. Can this be widened to match the text, as in Safari?

**Dallas** on 2004-04-05 21:22:47

> While the icons of the new default theme aren't as screaming as a bright blue Microsoft toolbar, they're still rather large and stylized, which competes with some websites.
