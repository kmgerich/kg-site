[Jon Hicks](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/2004/04/thunderbird/), with input from the [Mozilla Visual Identity Team](http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=4319), has designed a beautiful new logo and icon for [Mozilla Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/). Strong imagery. Great colors.

The new icon hasn’t made its way into the Mac OS X Thunderbird nightly builds yet, but when it is included it will be a great compliment to the new [Pinstripe theme](http://kmgerich.com/archive/images/thunderbird-progress.png).

> I downloaded the April 25 nightly, and it's got Jon's icon.  Thunderbirds looking real slick—makes me look forward to having all components of the mozilla suite in stand-alone form.

> Simply amazing, as usual.  John Hicks has an amazing eye for icons, as well as everything else design.  I also just found out about the newpinstripe theme  for the OSX version of Thunderbird, which looks incredible.  I&#8217;m so excited that I&#8217;m...
