A look at the history of a BBC News article provided by my [RSS aggregator](http://flock.sourceforge.net). Each of the three items in the image below link to the [same article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3640459.stm).

Update: Josh pointed out that the headline changed \*again\*. Now it reads “US chides Spain for Iraq pull-out”. Up next: “US gently cautions Spain not to track mud across its nice clean floor”.
