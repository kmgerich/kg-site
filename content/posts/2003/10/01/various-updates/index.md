You can find up to date builds of Mozilla Firebird in [this MozillaZine thread](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=19309). I have never used one of these builds so I can’t comment on them. YMMV.

Work on the Pinstripe theme continues at a slow pace. My day job has been soaking up most of my free time. The bulk of the time I spend on Pinstripe is on creating icons. As I’ve said before, I’m not a “graphic designer” so it takes me a long time to come up with something good. If anyone out there would like to lend a hand at creating icons, drop me an email. I hope to have the next Pinstripe version available for the release of Mozilla 1.5 final.
