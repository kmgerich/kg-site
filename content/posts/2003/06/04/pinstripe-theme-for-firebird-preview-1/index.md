Iâ€™ve been working on a version of Pinstripe for Mozilla Firebird lately though itâ€™s not fully baked. I figured Iâ€™d make this preview available to show my progress and get feedback. Iâ€™ve taken a cue from Safari on the bookmarks toolbar and have some new icon art. Go to [this page](/pinstripe/beta.html) to install. Please leave a comment or [send me an email](mailto:webmail@kmgerich.com) with your thoughts. Feel free to pick nits ðŸ™‚

**Update, June 14:** Iâ€™ve uploaded a [new preview of Pinstripe for Firebird](http://kmgerich.com/pinstripe/beta.html). Changes include more refined icons, more work on HIG friendliness, drop shadows, tweaked preferences window, etc. Iâ€™m still far from done but check it out and offer some feedback. Thanks!

> still rather rough around the edges, but a great start - i'm looking forward to what you have in store for the future :)

> I like the iconography for the navigation toolbar.
> 
> I prefer that tabs be left aligned (as in the default Firebird theme and Safari), making them more stable targets when opening and closing tabs frequently.
> 
> Keep up the great work!

> Beautiful work!

> I just noticed that the bookmark icon appears in the customize window, but when its dragged to the toolbar, no icon appears. There's a tiny, appr. 10 pixel wide space where the icon should appear, and clicking on this space brings up the bookmarks sidebar. Just letting you know.. :)

> I very much enjoy the themes that you have created. Keep up the good work.

**Bryan** on 2003-06-30 16:00:29
> Looks great.  Your pinstripe theme is heads above anything else out there.
> 
> Makes either Mozilla, and especially Firebird look like a Mac app.
> 
> Thanks for all your hard work.  It is appreciated!

> Why aren't they shipping this default with Pheonix and Moz?  It is WAY better than that stupid grey theme or the classic theme.
> 
> One question: Can you make the Tabs less bright?  That bright blue is really annoying.  I have Safari Aqua-ized and the Tabs are nice and subtle, with a shaded Aqua for deselected ones.  I think this would work for Pinstripe too.  WIth that it will be the perfect theme!  Safari and Pinstripe Phoenix, pimptastic! :D

> OK nevermind!  I noticed the Graphite selection.  I like the Aqua one though except for the bright Tabs..I'm torn apart!:/

**Neil** on 2003-08-29 10:38:26
> Hm. I just installed the final candidate build of Pinstripe for Firebird on the Aug. 27th nightly, and for some reason I don't have the back and forward buttons. Everything else is there and working, but I can't find these two buttons anywhere.

> Any thoughts?

**Neil** on 2003-08-29 10:40:38
> Sorry - one other boo-boo is that none of the dropdown menus work in the preferences, and I can't commit to preferences once I'm done (hitting "okay" does nothing). Thanks!

**Kevin** on 2003-08-29 16:40:54
> Neil, things are really in flux with Firebird right now. There have been some changes which break third-party themes. It doesn't help that there aren't official builds to use as a benchmark. I'm going away for the weekend but maybe Monday I'll try to figure this out.

> I am running the same version of Firebird as Neil and having the same problems. I also don't have a scroll bar.
> 
> A few times, I also tried reverting to the latest official release from mozillafoundation.org, deleting ~/Library/Phoenix before installing the newly-downloaded program, but after I install, it won't switch to Pinstripe on that version.
> 
> Last note: I really do like the theme. It is much better than the current default theme.

**matt** on 2003-09-28 13:47:38
> The theme works great with the Firebird build from your site.

> Firebird 0.7 official RCs are out; problems with Pinstripe are:
> 
> - Back and forward buttons gone
> - No scrollbar
> - No tabs/tab bar
> 
> I really hope you can update this with the changes they've made because it sure makes Firebird look a whole lot better. Good luck!
> 
> Will it be possible to make Aqua-like submit buttons as part of the theme?
