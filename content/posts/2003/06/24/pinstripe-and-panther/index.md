Iâ€™m curious to see what Pinstripe looks like on [Panther](http://www.apple.com/macosx/panther/). If someone fortunate enough to have a copy of the preview version can snap a screen shot (preferably a shot that shows the browser tabs) and [send it to me](mailto:webmail@kmgerich.com) I would be most appreciative.

> I found that Camino RELEASE version 0.7 works in Panther, it's the nightlies that break.
> I haven't tried installing an older build of mozilla, but that might work too.

> This is unrelated to the post but Pinstripe themes work with Netscape 7.1; but maybe you know that already. :)

> Ace is correct. The Pinstripe theme now works with no need to edit your files by hand in Mozilla 1.4 (which Netscape 7.1 is based on.) Hooray!

> Oh yeah! Thanks for the heads up guys - I'm sorry Pinstripe didn't work on Netscape 6-7 earlier, but I never could find the free time to sit down with it.

> Newest nightly of mozilla works on panther, but tabs dont seem to work.  Odd...

> Pinestripe doesn't work in my Netscape 7.1. Well it does, except for the composer feature where the icons are mixed up.

> To keep this thread off topic: Colina, I think I know what you experienced. All you have to do is open the Netscape preferences and change the icons in the composer toolbar. You can then change it back to what you had before. Once you've done this, you can enjoy Pinstripe like everyone else. Great stuff!
