Berkeley Breathed, author of the classic Bloom County and Outland comics is [returning to the funny pages](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45450-2003Sep8.html) at the end of November, 2003. The strip will be called “Opus” and will run in the Washington Post on Sundays only.

It will also run at a the size half a newspaper page, which is really cool. [Breathed](http://www.theonionavclub.com/avclub3728/avfeature_3728.html) and [other cartoonists](http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaarticles.html#100) have talked about the sad state of newspaper comics in terms of both size and content. Some of comments on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/09/09/130225&mode=thread&tid=133&tid=186) suggested that Breathed do a Web comic strip. I hope not. Computer screens have gotten less painful to look at in the last decade or so but they still can’t match the resolution, portability and affordability of newsprint.

I often thumb through a Bloom County collection late at night. I find it much more enjoyable than trying to absorb pages of prose before bedtime. Still – As much as I love the characters, worlds, and ideas that Breathed has brought to life in his work, I wonder if the new strip will be as fresh as Bloom County. I really enjoyed Outland but some of the jokes and the themes were recycled from older strips. But anyway that’s a small quibble. I’d take Berkeley Breathed’s recycled ideas over most cartoonist’s fresh ones.

Some of my favorite comics:

[Red Meat](http://www.redmeat.com/redmeat/)

> I agree that newsprint has an advantage with portability and resolution. But affordability? Hmmm. Regular price of the Washington Post is $88 for 26 weeks, or $176/yr for 7-day-a-week delivery. If you keep your computer for 3 years and buy a cheap no-brand (or build your own), not such a huge difference between $528 for the home-delivered Post and an eMachine.
