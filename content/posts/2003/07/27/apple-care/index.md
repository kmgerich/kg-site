I had planned to write a few glowing words about [Apple](http://www.apple.com) and their stellar repair service. My [Powerbook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html) has developed a [display problem](http://kmgerich.com/archive/images/badscreen1.jpg) over the past month. I called Apple support, talked to a very helpful support tech and he diagnosed my problem quickly. It seems I needed to have my logic board replaced. Okie dokie. So Apple shipped me a box and I packed my computer into it. I dropped the computer off at Airborne Express at noon last Wednesday and I received it back on Friday afternoon – just two days later. Talk about turnaround time!

This is where my glowing words fail to actually glow. The problem is, the Powerbook isn’t fixed and still has display issues. Here’s a [recent screenshot](http://kmgerich.com/archive/temp/badscreen2.pdf) \[PDF\] of what I’m seeing. I called Apple today and arranged to have my Powerbook shipped back to Texas for further fixing.

I wonder, does Apple put more effort into getting the repair done fast over getting it right? Lest you think that I only base this question on one experience: My girlfriend recently had some problems with her iBook’s keyboard and it took three tries before Apple actually fixed it.

> hmm, I thought it would have been a similar display problem as my iBook display problem, on my iBook I had green static (looks like i got a new screen though), does this ever appear before OSX is booted up? or just in OSX, i'm wondering if its something software related but I'm not sure

> Yeah, the static appeared before OS X was booted. When I booted the Hardware Test CD, it had the same static. I also saw the static on the apple logo as the machine was booing up.
