Announcing a Very Special Mozilla Theme! This theme is based on Pinstripe and follows the Aqua Human Interface Guidelines to the letter:

“In order to make toolbar icons easily distinguishable from one another, each icon should be a distinct animal. Use real-world objects (such as a moose) to facilitate quick recognition by users.”
