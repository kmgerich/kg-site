I really admire the music of [David Grisman](http://www.acousticdisc.com/dgq_splash.html), [Bill Monroe](http://www.billmonroe.com/), [The Jazz Mandolin Project](http://www.jazzmandolinproject.com/), etc. and I’m fan of the subtle sound of the mandloin. So I bought myself a cheapo instrument and I’m learning to play. It’s uphill work with me having no musical experience except as a listener. My fingers don’t want to move that way. But slowly I’m getting something that sounds like it might grow up to be music one day.

If anyone can point me to resources (web sites, books, tapes) that are helpful for a beginner, I’d be grateful.
