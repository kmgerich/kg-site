Can anyone shed some light on why [Phoenix on the Mac](misc.html) compiles just fine but gives a segmentation fault when I try to run the phoenix-bin file? I used the mozilla-bin file from a previous build of Mozilla in place of the bad phoenix-bin and to my surprise it seems to work. This probably causes problems that I havenâ€™t run across yet.

> Actually no. The build of Phoenix uses the Mozilla binary renamed to 'phoenix-bin'. Why this works I have no idea!

> I am currious how you got it to build at all.  And if it built ok, how did it run?  wouldnt you need Xwindows or to create a Cocoa wrapper or something?  I am by anymeans an accomplished C++ developer, just a hobyist.  I know you did it, cause it does work!

> Phoenix is based on Mozilla which is a Carbon front end with a Unix back end. The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/mac.html" rel="nofollow ugc">build instructions are here</a>. You have to pull the source and build Mozilla regularly. Then update your .mozconfig file with as in <a href="http://www.sitemason.com/page/eCIDQc" rel="nofollow ugc">this page</a> (without the last xft line). That'll build Phoenix. But the phoenix-bin will be corrupt somehow. You can use the phoenix-bin from my build or use a mozilla-bin file and rename it to phoenix-bin.

> i686 typically has to do with optimization for Pentium 2, 3, or 4 (I'm not sure where the boundry between i586 and i686 is). Optimizing something for a PC won't help it to run on a Mac.

> Ah, well I didn't use the i686 line either. This is the .mozconfig I used.
