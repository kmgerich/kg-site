This is a preview of an icon set Iâ€™m working on for Chimera. I may expand it into a Mozilla skin at some point.

> Hm. It looks a lot like the theme you include with your Phoenix build. :)

> Very observant! Actually I started creating this icon set for Chimera then used them for the Phoenix theme. I'm close to finishing the set - I'll post them and a new screenshot when I'm done.
