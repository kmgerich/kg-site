I’ve come to the conclusion that I have no life. Thankfully I have access to a large selection of products designed to solve this complex problem. Most of these solutions are “digital” in nature.

Apple Computer’s [iLife suite of products](http://www.apple.com/ilife/) helps me effortlessly manage my “digital lifestyle”. AT&T’s [mLife](http://www.mlife.com) let’s me be mobile on my own terms. Their advertisement tells me that “[we are meant to lead a truly wireless life](http://www.wirelessnewsfactor.com/perl/story/16150.html)“. They promise me “more minutes than ever before”. I’m not quite sure what that means but it sure sounds exciting! Sign me up!

Of course these products would be meaningless without a support system to guide my transition to digital Nirvana. Luckily my good friends at [T-Mobile](http://www.t-mobile.com) prompt me to “get more out of life”. And thanks to interventions by the kind folks at Verizon Wireless, I’m making [progress every day](http://www22.verizon.com/progress/).
