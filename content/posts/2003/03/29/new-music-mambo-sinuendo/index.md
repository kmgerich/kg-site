[Mambo Sinuendo](http://nonesuch.com/Hi_Band/index_frameset2.htm "Mambo Sinuendo at Nonesuch Records") by Ry Cooder and Manuel Galbán: This is the kind of album that I often look for when selecting music to fit the mood I’m in. The groovin’, swingin’ and sometimes muted tunes don’t demand your full attention – they can float by themselves in the background. Click the link above and listen to some samples.
