This update to the stand-alone Pinstripe theme turned out to be more of a redesign than [I originally intended](http://kmgerich.com/2006/08/05/firefox-1x-classic-themes-available/). Stephen Horlander sent in a cool concept for the browser tabs. Check out the etched text on the inactive tabs. You’ll see some of the other details in the screenshot below. The theme has some rough edges but should be usable. As always I appreciate your feedback.

[Install the Pinstripe Theme](javascript:void\(InstallTrigger.installChrome\(InstallTrigger.SKIN,'http://kmgerich.com/downloads/pinstripe_firefox.jar','Pinstripe v4.9'\)\)) (_requires [Firefox 2.0RC1](http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-2.0rc1&os=osx&lang=en-US) or later on Mac OS X_)

## Comments

**Dan V. P. Christiansen** on 2006-09-27 10:35:35
> *Very* nice upgrade. You should convince the Firefox developers to bundle this theme in Firefox 2.0. That would at least give people an option to have Firefox behave like a proper Mac application.

> Personal dislikings of OSX aside, those tabs are probably more "native" looking that actual native OSX tabs. :D

**HÃ¥kan Waaara** on 2006-09-27 11:19:43

**Mario** on 2006-09-27 11:22:51
> They look very nice... i think it would look better if you could get a unified toolbar like camino.

**Kevin** on 2006-09-27 12:00:55
> I think a true unified toolbar would be difficult to implement in XUL. Camino can do it because they use a Mac native UI. We tried to do a sort of pseudo-unified look with the gray gradient. That's probably the best a theme can do for now.

**JosÃ© Jeria** on 2006-09-27 12:02:32
> Looks really nice. Though one minor thing, the close button next to the favicon makes it look a bit crowded.

**Josh Hughes** on 2006-09-27 12:08:44
> Looks very nice! Well done!

> My one comment: The etching on inactive tabs looks a bit off when the text is longer than the tab (i.e. it finishes with an ellipsis).

**Jon Hicks** on 2006-09-27 13:38:00
> Wow. I think you're underselling yourselves with 20%! More like 80%! Seriously, this has gorgeous attention to detail - it's everything the official mac theme for FF2 isn't.

**Stephen Horlander** on 2006-09-27 13:43:51
> He didn't even post a screenshot of the awesome sidebar ;)

**Hanspeter** on 2006-09-27 13:48:37
> ack! It hides my menu bar when I use it under OSX/X11.

**Kevin** on 2006-09-27 13:52:53
> You run Firefox under OSX/X11?! That's crazy talk.

**Hanspeter** on 2006-09-27 14:37:10
> I can ssh tunel to the Mac inside the school firewall to access internal web servers, which I can't connect to through the normal AppleTalk server connect to run the native Firefox.app.
> 
> ps.  the right side of the comment textbox hides  the last 4 characters (they do get typed in though).  This is on a normal OSX Firefox.  I'm guessing it's set at a width that's wider than the column it's contained in.  With Safari, the right half of the scrollbar is chopped off (supporting my idea).

**TomL** on 2006-09-27 15:51:41
> The tabs are great. Very nice. I have to say though, I have grown tired of the FF1.5 icon set and am enjoying the new icons in the default FF2.0 theme.
> 
> Thanks for the theme though! Nice work!

**Nick Fagerlund** on 2006-09-27 18:52:42
> Lordy, <em>yes.</em> THAT is what a 2.0 theme looks like.
> 
> The tab overflow controls need some more definition, including a greyed end-of-the-line state for the scrollboxes--file under "rough edges." But never mind that for now: you've done some very good work, so thank you.

**Jim Barraud** on 2006-09-27 19:52:41

**Eric** on 2006-09-27 21:44:13
> Looks great! One quibble though... when one uses 'small icons' in the toolbar, the gradient is not smooth into the tabs - there's a noticeable line at the top of each tab.
> 
> Other than that, is there an easy way to make the default buttons in FF2 not look like crap?

**Josh** on 2006-09-27 22:16:19
> This is indeed a huge improvement.  I love the gradient in the toolbar -- it's such a small thing but it really makes a difference.  And yes, those sidebars are snazzy.
> 
> Maybe a combination of this theme with the official 2.0 theme -- using the new icons (and fixing them) -- could be the official Mac theme?

**jed** on 2006-09-28 00:07:41
> Wow, just installed it, and it's even better than your screenshot :)
> 
> I too however am seeing that odd issue with text boxes, including this box here. I wonder if it's a theme or Firefox 2 bug?
> 
> Small nitpick, I don't like the 'blue' color of the tab text background gradient either.. would look alot more sexy grey.

> A bug report...
> When navigating trees (like the left pane of the DomInspector, or in the bookmarks window), a click everywhere on a row highlights the whole row. I need to double-click on the little arrow to open up the tree. This doesn't happen with the default theme: click on the label in a row to highlight, click on the arrow to open.

**Martin** on 2006-09-28 03:23:27
> I love this theme. Thanks!

**clem** on 2006-09-28 04:54:26
> Showing actual inactive tabs is just a waste of precious tab space IMO. I use middle-click to close tabs so have the close box disabled too. I use UNO along with the userchrome.css bit of Arranox's FF theme for UNO and a modified version of the old Safari Tabs userchrome hack and it works out pretty well for a unified toolbar look with more Mac-like tabs.

Green for Go seems obvious enough, but I'm not sure what colour would be most appropriate for Search. Blue maybe, a la Spotlight?

> [...] I have been using Firefox 2.0 RC 1 ever since it was launched. Some of the in-built features such as spellcheck and session saver convinced me partially overlooking the pain of not being able to use del.icio.us plugin that I use the most. And then came the Pinstripe theme which convinced me completely to go for Firefox 2 RC 1, but the problem of the plugin not working was still bothering me somewhere. As I was looking for a tool similar to delicious plugin, I saw Nightly Tester Tool which enables you to install the extensions that are incompatible with the nightly builds of Firefox. So if you know your extension will work, or you are confident enough, go ahead and acquire Firefox 2 RC 1, Pinstripe theme and Nightly Tester Tool to get the best browsing experience. [...]

> Great redesign. The only thing that has prevented my consistent use of firefox was the location of the close tab. Your version brings it much closer than 20% IMHO. I like that it gives me the safari feel/control without the brushed metal I detest. Your theme looks much cleaner, great work!

**Jason** on 2006-10-02 12:45:39
> To change the color of the tabs, use your favorite extraction tool on the theme jar file (mine's "the unarchiver").  Navigate to the global folder, find the tab graphics (you'll know them when you see them), edit them, then highlight all the files under the folder automatically created by the unarchiver, right-click and choose to create an archive.  Rename the archive from .zip to .jar and install.

Very nice.

**Bart** on 2006-10-30 13:06:52
> Thank you for making this theme. The only thing I'm not really a big fan of is the icon in the search bar with the dark border around it. It doesn't look Mac-like (the circle should just be a knocked-out solid gray color) and it doesn't match the icon in the Find toolbar (which is the magnifying glass without a circle around it). And is it just me or is there a purple shade over the active tab?

**Bart** on 2006-10-31 12:29:23
> My other suggestion for this theme is with the highlight color when the addressbar and search bar are in focus. All my other programs have the focus be a blue color that matches the blue of the scrollbar pill. I feel like the shade you're using is more of a purple? Reminds of of OS 9's folder icons. I think the blue would make it fit in with the overall OS better. And also, is there no standard for the blue background color that you use for the Find Bar and the History sidebar? I'm noticing that Mail has a different color from iTunes which has a different color than NetNewswire which has a different color from your theme (though your themes tilt more towards the purple side).

> Other than that I want to thank you again for making this theme. The more I use it the more I notice the little details, like the Find bar, that you thought through very well.

**Firefox 2 tidbits :: medicinalchemistry** on 2007-01-01 05:23:30
> [...] There&#8217;s a lot to like about Firefox 2 but there are a few changes that long-time users such as me are finding quite annoying. The new default theme looks consistently bad across platforms (and particularly so in Mac OS X). Fortunately, designers Kevin Gerich and Stephen Horlander have updated the venerable Firefox 1.x default themes Pinstripe (Mac OS X) and Winstripe (Windows) for use in Firefox 2. Secondly, the Find As You Type search bar has been pointlessly &#8220;simplified&#8221;. Once again the customisability of Firefox comes into its own here, and it&#8217;s simply a matter of inserting the following line into your local userchrome.css file. /* Use the old-style / and &#8216; QuickFind Bar behaviour */ #FindToolbar &gt; * {display:-moz-box} [...]
