<p>This update to the stand-alone Pinstripe theme turned out to be more of a redesign than <a href="http://kmgerich.com/2006/08/05/firefox-1x-classic-themes-available/">I originally intended</a>. Stephen Horlander sent in a cool concept for the browser tabs. Check out the etched text on the inactive tabs. You’ll see some of the other details in the screenshot below. The theme has some rough edges but should be usable. As always I appreciate your feedback.</p>

<p>I think a true unified toolbar would be difficult to implement in XUL. Camino can do it because they use a Mac native UI. We tried to do a sort of pseudo-unified look with the gray gradient. That's probably the best a theme can do for now.</p>

<p>ps.  the right side of the comment textbox hides  the last 4 characters (they do get typed in though).  This is on a normal OSX Firefox.  I'm guessing it's set at a width that's wider than the column it's contained in.  With Safari, the right half of the scrollbar is chopped off (supporting my idea).</p>

<p>Lordy, <em>yes.</em> THAT is what a 2.0 theme looks like.</p>
<p>The tab overflow controls need some more definition, including a greyed end-of-the-line state for the scrollboxes--file under &quot;rough edges.&quot; But never mind that for now: you've done some very good work, so thank you.</p>

<p>icon size (large, small) check.
close button on the left. check.
background on tabbar, bookmarkbar, toolbar. check.</p>
<p>This looks quite good !</p>
<p>I'm not so enthusiast about the blueish glare on the active tab though. Greyish would be a lot smarter.
The use of bold font-face on the tabs is problematic. This makes East-Asian characters very hard to read.</p>
<p>I think Arronax! has some serious competition here.</p>
<p>PS - you shouldn't scale this textarea's width in ems. Part of it disappears for those older visitors who need larger font sizes.</p>

<p>Looks great! One quibble though... when one uses 'small icons' in the toolbar, the gradient is not smooth into the tabs - there's a noticeable line at the top of each tab.</p>
<p>Other than that, is there an easy way to make the default buttons in FF2 not look like crap?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Josh</strong> on 2006-09-27 22:16:19</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is indeed a huge improvement.  I love the gradient in the toolbar -- it's such a small thing but it really makes a difference.  And yes, those sidebars are snazzy.</p>
<p>Maybe a combination of this theme with the official 2.0 theme -- using the new icons (and fixing them) -- could be the official Mac theme?</p>

<p>Small nitpick, I don't like the 'blue' color of the tab text background gradient either.. would look alot more sexy grey.</p>

<p>A bug report...
When navigating trees (like the left pane of the DomInspector, or in the bookmarks window), a click everywhere on a row highlights the whole row. I need to double-click on the little arrow to open up the tree. This doesn't happen with the default theme: click on the label in a row to highlight, click on the arrow to open.</p>
<p>Strangely, that works fine in the sidebar (tested with the bookmarks sidebar).</p>

<p>Showing actual inactive tabs is just a waste of precious tab space IMO. I use middle-click to close tabs so have the close box disabled too. I use UNO along with the userchrome.css bit of Arranox's FF theme for UNO and a modified version of the old Safari Tabs userchrome hack and it works out pretty well for a unified toolbar look with more Mac-like tabs.</p>

<p>Very nice! Personally I'd make just one change (well, two really, but they're related). The Go and Search buttons appear greyed out, even though they're available for use. Green for Go seems obvious enough, but I'm not sure what colour would be most appropriate for Search. Blue maybe, a la Spotlight?</p>

<p>[...] I have been using Firefox 2.0 RC 1 ever since it was launched. Some of the in-built features such as spellcheck and session saver convinced me partially overlooking the pain of not being able to use del.icio.us plugin that I use the most. And then came the Pinstripe theme which convinced me completely to go for Firefox 2 RC 1, but the problem of the plugin not working was still bothering me somewhere. As I was looking for a tool similar to delicious plugin, I saw Nightly Tester Tool which enables you to install the extensions that are incompatible with the nightly builds of Firefox. So if you know your extension will work, or you are confident enough, go ahead and acquire Firefox 2 RC 1, Pinstripe theme and Nightly Tester Tool to get the best browsing experience. [...]</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> on 2006-10-02 12:45:39</p>

<p>To change the color of the tabs, use your favorite extraction tool on the theme jar file (mine's &quot;the unarchiver&quot;).  Navigate to the global folder, find the tab graphics (you'll know them when you see them), edit them, then highlight all the files under the folder automatically created by the unarchiver, right-click and choose to create an archive.  Rename the archive from .zip to .jar and install.</p>

<p>I like the new theme, but agree with the other posts about the blue highlight on the tabs.  I also would like to see a variant without the blue/purple down state on the bookmark bar items.  To be 'savvy' the down state should be a dark gray like the default Firefox 2 theme.  The find interface however, is great. =)</p>

<p>Actually, I'd like the opposite. I like Pinestripes' less safari-like buttons and the awesome tabs, but I miss all the GrApple extras for the sidebar and extensions like Sage, Web Developer Toolbar, Scrapbook, etc.</p>
<p>Now that GrApple seems to have discontinued their &quot;Pro&quot; series, in favor of the safari-like Eos, I hope a combined theme is in the cards in the near future.</p>

<p>Hi,
Just wanted to say I love this new theme.  The subtle glow on the tabs is simply very nice.  It's topped only by the beauty of the sidebar--which has led me to change my browsing habits, getting rid of the &quot;bookmarks toolbar&quot; entirely and adding the &quot;bookmarks sidebar&quot; button to my toolbar so that I can see it often.  Very nice.</p>
<p>I was just in Thunderbird, though, and couldn't help but think how nice the sidebar treatment would look on the &quot;Folders&quot; pane.  Any chances of seeing a Thunderbird Pinstripe update?  Might this be an update coming to Thunderbird 2.0, or are you no longer working on that theme, either?  (BTW, I've looked and not been able to find the answer anywhere: they're not making Qute the default Thunderbird theme for OSX, are they?)</p>
<p>Finally, for all the nay-sayers who say &quot;nay,&quot; do you have any plans to open up the artwork changes from this update like you did back in July? http://kmgerich.com/2006/07/11/firefox-browser-ui-artwork-released/
This move would allow people to repackage different color themes (blue, graphite, etc.) and take some of the (practically non-existent, I must admit) pressure off of you.</p>
<p>Anyway, to reiterate, thank you for such a lovely theme!</p>

<p>Hey Chad,</p>
<p>You'll want to start Firefox in Safe Mode.  In the Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Mozilla Firefox folder there should be an icon named Mozilla Firefox (Safe Mode).</p>
<p>If you don't have such an icon, right-click on whatever Firefox icon you can find, choose properties, and change the text in the TARGET box to be this:</p>
<p>&quot;C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe&quot; -safe-mode</p>

<p>Thank you for making this theme. The only thing I'm not really a big fan of is the icon in the search bar with the dark border around it. It doesn't look Mac-like (the circle should just be a knocked-out solid gray color) and it doesn't match the icon in the Find toolbar (which is the magnifying glass without a circle around it). And is it just me or is there a purple shade over the active tab?</p>

<p><strong>Bart</strong> on 2006-10-31 12:29:23</p>

<p>My other suggestion for this theme is with the highlight color when the addressbar and search bar are in focus. All my other programs have the focus be a blue color that matches the blue of the scrollbar pill. I feel like the shade you're using is more of a purple? Reminds of of OS 9's folder icons. I think the blue would make it fit in with the overall OS better. And also, is there no standard for the blue background color that you use for the Find Bar and the History sidebar? I'm noticing that Mail has a different color from iTunes which has a different color than NetNewswire which has a different color from your theme (though your themes tilt more towards the purple side).</p>
<p>Other than that I want to thank you again for making this theme. The more I use it the more I notice the little details, like the Find bar, that you thought through very well.</p>

<p>[...] There’s a lot to like about Firefox 2 but there are a few changes that long-time users such as me are finding quite annoying. The new default theme looks consistently bad across platforms (and particularly so in Mac OS X). Fortunately, designers Kevin Gerich and Stephen Horlander have updated the venerable Firefox 1.x default themes Pinstripe (Mac OS X) and Winstripe (Windows) for use in Firefox 2. Secondly, the Find As You Type search bar has been pointlessly “simplified”. Once again the customisability of Firefox comes into its own here, and it’s simply a matter of inserting the following line into your local userchrome.css file. /* Use the old-style / and ‘ QuickFind Bar behaviour */ #FindToolbar &gt; * {display:-moz-box} [...]</p>

<p>Does anyone have a version without the blue on the tabs (and down state on the bookmarks bar items) that they'd be willing to share?  I love this theme, but those inconsistencies are really grating.</p>

<p>I have been hesitant to release the &quot;Pinstripe for Windows&quot; theme because of a single bug I have been unable to eliminate.  However, since you have expressed interest, I will give you instructions to allow you to use the &quot;Pinstripe&quot; theme on Windows.</p>
<p>Let me explain the situation to you.  It is possible to install Kevin's Pinstripe theme on any Windows Firefox installation.  However three problems occurr:</p>
<ol>
<li>The menu bar is hidden.</li>
<li>The close buttons on inactive tabs are invisible.</li>
<li>The menus and popup menus are entirely black.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will show you how to fix each of these step by step.</p>
<p>#1</p>
<p>Prior to applying the &quot;Pinstripe&quot; theme, install the &quot;Personal Menu&quot; extension through Firefox Addons.  Basically, this extension gives you buttons to access all the menus through the navigation bar instead of the menu bar.  Restart Firefox.</p>
<p>#2</p>
<p>Install the &quot;tab mix plus&quot; extension.  Restart Firefox.  Click Tools&gt;Tab Mix Plus Options.  Click &quot;Display.&quot;  Click the &quot;Tab&quot; tab.  Uncheck the &quot;Close Tab Button&quot; checkbox.  Click the &quot;Tab Bar&quot; tab.  Check the &quot;Close Tab Button&quot; checkbox.  Click &quot;Apply&quot; then click &quot;OK.&quot;</p>
<p>#3</p>
<p>Install the ChromEdit Plus Extensions from here (http://webdesigns.ms11.net/chromeditp.html).  Restart firefox.  Click Tools&gt;ChromEdit Plus&gt;ChromEdit.</p>
<p>Paste the following code at the end of the text field, afterwards restarting firefox:</p>
<p>/* Classic Menus */
