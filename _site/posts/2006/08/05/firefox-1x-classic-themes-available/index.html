The Firefox 1.x classic default themes, called Pinstripe on Mac and Winstripe on Windows, are available for your installing and downloading pleasure.</p>
<p>These are simply stand-alone versions of the Firefox themes before the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/FX2_Visual_Update/Default_Theme_Update">Firefox “visual refresh”</a> landed. The themes require at least Firefox 2.0b1. I will work on them in the coming weeks to smooth out the rough spots. I tested the themes on my machines but they may be buggy. Please let me know if they don’t work for you.</p>

<p>Whilst I can see the theme refresh has broader appeal and does actually work quite well within Windows XP's Luna theme... it really feels out of place under Classic with OS palette changed to that of Windows 2000.</p>
<p>So I'm glad that Winstripe is sticking around and hopefully carry on being maintained too. :D</p>

<p>Do you know why the &quot;Go&quot; button was combined w/ the search field?  I don't like having the &quot;Go&quot; button up there.  It's very strange.</p>
<p>Also, a nit.  The magnifying glass seems off in Winstripe Classic for Windows.  It seems out of place.  But thanks for maintaining this theme.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m using the latest nightly and i see an incredibly long â€œgoâ€ button, as well as an extra thin search box.  It is also connected to the address bar, but I don't mind that.  What I mind is it's RIDICULOUS horizontal length</p>

<p>Just thought I'd give the heads up that the background for the search button is fixed now, presumably due to the aforementioned button being fixed to inherit the native background - it's no longer grey.</p>
<p>One of the check ins for the drop down button has caused a problem though - it is too wide and shifts when the length of the string within location bar changes.</p>
<p>Has anyone know the fix for the latter? And also, how to give the search drop down selector a native bevel.</p>

<p>Thanks for fixing the link, Legege.  So it looks like there are 2 options now for getting a working Winstripe theme, in case anyone is reading this.  You can use the modified theme by Sethramoth available here:</p>
<p>http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ZRJADU9E</p>
<p>And in that case you will need to add the following bit of code to your userChrome.css file to fix the issue Bigbootay pointed out (which you will also find if you look at any page at the Wikipedia):</p>
<p>.searchbar-engine-button {
list-style: none !important;
}</p>
<p>I determined that to be the operative line of Legege's code, for fixing the bug in Sethramoth's theme.  You can find all of it here, in case you want to use Kevin Gerich's original Winstripe 0.9 instead of the modified one by Sethramoth, since it seems to solve all the problems:</p>
<p>http://legege.com/mozilla/bugs/userChrome-winstripe-fx2.0rc2.css</p>
<p>But it might be tough for you to find your chrome directory in your profile directory (which is in %appdata%\mozilla\firefox\profiles on Windows XP, in case you are interested).  And even if you do edit your userChrome.css file (which does not even exist by default), anything you do will impact other themes and possibly ruin them, if you like to switch between themes.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a much simpler solution.</p>
<p>Florian Schmitz's Winestripe theme is at 1.0 now and he fixed the problems that made the search bar look so ugly for me (I use Windows Classic style).  You can get it here:</p>
<p>http://cdburnerxp.se/winestripe/</p>
<p>I didn't like the original Winestripe he made but it is better now, and does not require any userChrome.css hacking.  So, now there are two different themes to choose from, to emulate the classic Firefox 1.x look, and they both work on Firefox 2.0, which has finally been released.  If you still do not have Firefox 2.0, get it here:</p>

<p>A big thank you! Something wasn't sitting right with me on the new default FF2 theme, so glad I found your site!</p>

<p>When will the developers recognize that you can't give software a new look just for kicks? There are people out here that chose Firefox because of a simpler look. Now, to maintain security, we are forced to upgrade to this. The arrogance. Goodbye, Firefox.</p>

<p>What about Linux? Can we install Winstripe or are you going to release a specific Gnomestripe version?
Thanks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[...] There’s a lot to like about Firefox 2 but there are a few changes that long-time users such as me are finding quite annoying. The new default theme looks consistently bad across platforms (and particularly so in Mac OS X). Fortunately, designers Kevin Gerich and Stephen Horlander have updated the venerable Firefox 1.x default themes Pinstripe (Mac OS X) and Winstripe (Windows) for use in Firefox 2. Secondly, the Find As You Type search bar has been pointlessly “simplified”. Once again the customisability of Firefox comes into its own here, and it’s simply a matter of inserting the following line into your local userchrome.css file. /* Use the old-style / and ‘ QuickFind Bar behaviour */ #FindToolbar &gt; * {display:-moz-box} [...]</p>

<p>This appears not working well on Firefox 2. Can you fix it? I want to try it. I prefer stripes over new version. Thanks.</p>

<p>What a shame the makers of these fine themes are so anti-Linux. It's no wonder Linux is never &quot;ready for the desktop&quot; when people like this only support proprietary OSes.</p>
<p>Perhaps their unwillingness to help with other OSes is why the Firefox team went with commercial artists instead of stuck up prima-donna artistes like these cunts.</p>

<p>@Andy:</p>
<p>Forget about linux, these fucks are too busy licking Bill Gates and Steve Jobs' nutsacks to provide anything for Linux.</p>
<p>&quot;Artiste&quot; types hate Linux users because they're &quot;intellectual property&quot; hoarders, and Linux users are sharers.</p>
<p>&quot;Artistes&quot; find the typical viewpoint of a Linux user sickening.</p>
<p>These designer types are typical faggoty little whining bitches who expect to be praised and worshipped for their &quot;art&quot; no matter how sadly unoriginal and derivative it is. Pretty much like Microsoft and Apple.</p>
<p>Real artists code. Phony faggot bitches draw.</p>

<p>I think we can all agree that the correct way to encourage contribution to Linux is to refer to people as &quot;phony faggot bitches&quot;.</p>

<p>Hey, at least you're actually talking about Linux now instead of ignoring people asking about it.</p>

<p>So Kevin, what is going on with regards to a Linux version anyway?</p>
<p>Or have you reverted to ignoring comments by Linux users again?</p>
<p>A little civility towards people asking about a Linux version would go a long way, and save having to resort to childish taunts just to get a response.</p>
<p>Linux users have eyes too you know.</p>

<p>Regards Linux, I just installed for Ubuntu 6.06 and have had no problems so far.</p>
<p>TBH - themes are so easy to install, try out for 10 mins and then delete/keep I'm not sure why no-one has tried this already! :)</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for doing this, I hate the FF2 theme with a vengence.</p>

<p>Thanks for fixing the link, Legege. So it looks like there are 2 options now for getting a working Winstripe theme, in case anyone is reading this. You can use the modified theme by Sethramoth available here:</p>
