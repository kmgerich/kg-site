<p>The Mac Firebird theme is still not compatible with Tabbrowser Extentions. I’ve contacted the TBE author about compatibility but have not received a reply. If any of you would like to let the author know that you’d like TBE to work with Mac Firebird, you can post here: <a href="http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/forum/">http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/forum/</a></p>
<p><strong>Update January 23:</strong> Apparently there is a <a href="http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/_tabextensions.html.en#accessories">patch on Piro’s site</a> that makes TBE work with Mac Firebird. I can’t confirm this and I probably won’t have time to test it this weekend. I’d be grateful if someone could download the patch, try it out and write out simple instructions that I can post here. Thanks!</p>

<p>Good idea.</p>
<p>But I would better love to see a new pinstripe version for the full mozilla suite. I still use the suite instead of Thunderbird/Firebird and I would love to see pinestripe comming for this version soo.</p>
<p>Please work on a new pinstripe version for mozilla 1.5+ because this stops me from using any newer version :(</p>
<p>cheers...</p>

<p>Please!!!!</p>
<p>Thanks,
Michael</p>

<p>I abhor the suite.  Thanks for working on this for firebird first!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Pinstripe for Mozilla 1.5 would be a nice Christmas present. Please work in it !</p>

<p>Ok, I did. I hope this helps. ;)</p>

<p>Does that mean we can find a 1.5-compatible version in a few weeks?  Firebird looks great, but still lacks some important features that the full suite has (like form completion)...</p>

<p>TBE? No, thanks. However, I would love to see MultiZilla support for the birds, because that is my number one, always loved it.</p>
<p>TBE is just a clone of MultiZilla ;)</p>

<p>To be perfectly frank, the lack of Pinstripe for Moz 1.5+ is what stopped me from using it as well. It's just too un-Mac-like for me to use now.</p>

<p>There are numerous requests on the Tabbrowser Extensions site asking for compatibility. It's still not there. Tried it yesterday. Indeed doesn't work (&quot;No XBL binding for browser&quot;). I'm going nuts with all the extra windows I'm getting! I want tabs!</p>

<p>Moz 1.6 now and I am still on a 1.5 alpha as I can't bear Moz on OS X without pinstripe. Whilst the latest pinstripe incarnation with firebird rocks - its the moz suite I use. Just a fix to the old-school pinstripe I'm still using would be great - it would at least let me in on moz 1.6!</p>

<p>Kudos on this theme, it really makes Firebird a first class browser on the Mac. Any chance of a Thunderbird version?</p>

<p>Piro just published a patch for OS X and TBE, available just under &quot;Downloads&quot;.  I can't test it right now (Mac is home), can anyone check and verify?</p>

<p>Doesn't work on my build (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040111 Firebird/0.8.0+).</p>
<p>After installing TBE and then the patch, I don't get a browser window at all. A minute or so after requesting a new window an XBL Binding error comes up.</p>

<p><a href="http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/forum/?579" rel="nofollow ugc">This forum post</a> apparently describes how to fix the XBL binding error. Has anyone had success?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jon Hicks</strong> on 2004-01-24 05:16:40</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It helps get past the XBL binding error, and you can get a browser window this time, but there are display issues. The active tab displays as a inactive tab (greyed out), and all new tabs open to the right (even after changing the preference).</p>
<p>Its getting there, but its not compatible yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ernie</strong> on 2004-02-06 20:01:17</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried the directions and they got me past the XBL error. Tab placement does look screwed up, but I'm much happier than I was before making the change in chrome.rdf.</p>
<p>I'm using a nightly firebird build from a couple of weeks ago in Panther FWIW.</p>
