<p>I had planned to write a few glowing words about <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> and their stellar repair service. My <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html">Powerbook</a> has developed a <a href="http://kmgerich.com/archive/images/badscreen1.jpg">display problem</a> over the past month. I called Apple support, talked to a very helpful support tech and he diagnosed my problem quickly. It seems I needed to have my logic board replaced. Okie dokie. So Apple shipped me a box and I packed my computer into it. I dropped the computer off at Airborne Express at noon last Wednesday and I received it back on Friday afternoon – just two days later. Talk about turnaround time!</p>
<p>This is where my glowing words fail to actually glow. The problem is, the Powerbook isn’t fixed and still has display issues. Here’s a <a href="http://kmgerich.com/archive/temp/badscreen2.pdf">recent screenshot</a> [PDF] of what I’m seeing. I called Apple today and arranged to have my Powerbook shipped back to Texas for further fixing.</p>
<p>I wonder, does Apple put more effort into getting the repair done fast over getting it right? Lest you think that I only base this question on one experience: My girlfriend recently had some problems with her iBook’s keyboard and it took three tries before Apple actually fixed it.</p>

<p>hmm, I thought it would have been a similar display problem as my iBook display problem, on my iBook I had green static (looks like i got a new screen though), does this ever appear before OSX is booted up? or just in OSX, i'm wondering if its something software related but I'm not sure</p>

<p>Yeah, the static appeared before OS X was booted. When I booted the Hardware Test CD, it had the same static. I also saw the static on the apple logo as the machine was booing up.</p>
<p>I have my machine back now. Apple replaced the logic board (again) and the LCD display. Now it's as good as new! I love this machine (oh, except for the poor Airport reception).</p>

<p>Apparently many people are having problems with iBooks, including me.  There is a chronic problem with the logic boards.  See
