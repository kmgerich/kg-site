<p>The first <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/asa/archives/003196.html">“official” builds of Mozilla Firebird</a> for Mac OS X have appeared on <a href="http://komodo.mozilla.org/pub/phoenix/nightly/latest-trunk/">Mozilla.org’s site</a>. I’m taking down my experimental build because it’s no longer necessary. Mac Firebird needs some love to come up to the level of quality that we expect from a Mozilla product. So I encourage you to download an official build and file bugs in <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a>. In answer to some folks questions, yes I will eventually rewrite the <a href="http://kmgerich.com/pinstripe/pinstripe.html">the Pinstripe theme</a> to work on the Mozilla app suite and Mozilla Firebird.</p>

<p>You did a great job with your pheonix build, and I look forward to your new pinstripe theme... it really makes Mozilla on OS X feel like it belongs.</p>
<p>The problem with the official firebird release is that it doesn't follow OS X interface guidelines, I'm also not a huge fan of the icon. I hope you are able to persuade the Mozilla team to adopt your theme for 1.5- it would be a shame to see such a milestone with such little support for some very basic things in OS X.</p>

<p>I can't tell it apart in my dock from plain old Mozilla. Now I have two Phoenix versions, yours and the official one. Not sure on the interface as I have my OS X skinned and the browser sortof fits but it needs better icons. So does Camino for that matter. Still trying out the official one.</p>

<p>I hope to see mail icons at some point too - the standard icons stick out like a sore thumb with the elegant pinstripe theme. :)</p>

<p>Although I never got the chance to use your unofficial port, thanks for doing it...</p>

<p>Boy, now that there are official Firebird builds, I <em>really, really hope</em> that you get a Pinstripe theme out soon. I feel like I'm running a Windows XP program on my Mac, which is a bit discombobulating.</p>
<p>Any news?</p>

<p>I have started bringing Pinstripe to Firebird, though I just got back from a trip to Virginia and haven't had much free time lately. I hope to do some work on it next weekend.</p>
