<p>Iâ€™ve been working on a version of Pinstripe for Mozilla Firebird lately though itâ€™s not fully baked. I figured Iâ€™d make this preview available to show my progress and get feedback. Iâ€™ve taken a cue from Safari on the bookmarks toolbar and have some new icon art. Go to <a href="/pinstripe/beta.html">this page</a> to install. Please leave a comment or <a href="mailto:webmail@kmgerich.com">send me an email</a> with your thoughts. Feel free to pick nits ðŸ™‚</p>
<p><strong>Update, June 14:</strong> Iâ€™ve uploaded a <a href="http://kmgerich.com/pinstripe/beta.html">new preview of Pinstripe for Firebird</a>. Changes include more refined icons, more work on HIG friendliness, drop shadows, tweaked preferences window, etc. Iâ€™m still far from done but check it out and offer some feedback. Thanks!</p>

<p>still rather rough around the edges, but a great start - i'm looking forward to what you have in store for the future :)</p>

<p>I like the iconography for the navigation toolbar.</p>
<p>I prefer that tabs be left aligned (as in the default Firebird theme and Safari), making them more stable targets when opening and closing tabs frequently.</p>
<p>Keep up the great work!</p>

<p>I just noticed that the bookmark icon appears in the customize window, but when its dragged to the toolbar, no icon appears. There's a tiny, appr. 10 pixel wide space where the icon should appear, and clicking on this space brings up the bookmarks sidebar. Just letting you know.. :)</p>

<p>I very much enjoy the themes that you have created. Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>Looks great.  Your pinstripe theme is heads above anything else out there.</p>
<p>Makes either Mozilla, and especially Firebird look like a Mac app.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your hard work.  It is appreciated!</p>

<p>Why aren't they shipping this default with Pheonix and Moz?  It is WAY better than that stupid grey theme or the classic theme.</p>
<p>One question: Can you make the Tabs less bright?  That bright blue is really annoying.  I have Safari Aqua-ized and the Tabs are nice and subtle, with a shaded Aqua for deselected ones.  I think this would work for Pinstripe too.  WIth that it will be the perfect theme!  Safari and Pinstripe Phoenix, pimptastic! :D</p>

<p>OK nevermind!  I noticed the Graphite selection.  I like the Aqua one though except for the bright Tabs..I'm torn apart!:/</p>

<p>Hm. I just installed the final candidate build of Pinstripe for Firebird on the Aug. 27th nightly, and for some reason I don't have the back and forward buttons. Everything else is there and working, but I can't find these two buttons anywhere.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neil</strong> on 2003-08-29 10:40:38</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry - one other boo-boo is that none of the dropdown menus work in the preferences, and I can't commit to preferences once I'm done (hitting &quot;okay&quot; does nothing). Thanks!</p>

<p>Neil, things are really in flux with Firebird right now. There have been some changes which break third-party themes. It doesn't help that there aren't official builds to use as a benchmark. I'm going away for the weekend but maybe Monday I'll try to figure this out.</p>

<p>I am running the same version of Firebird as Neil and having the same problems. I also don't have a scroll bar.</p>
<p>A few times, I also tried reverting to the latest official release from mozillafoundation.org, deleting ~/Library/Phoenix before installing the newly-downloaded program, but after I install, it won't switch to Pinstripe on that version.</p>
<p>Last note: I really do like the theme. It is much better than the current default theme.</p>

<p>The theme works great with the Firebird build from your site.</p>

<p>Firebird 0.7 official RCs are out; problems with Pinstripe are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back and forward buttons gone</li>
<li>No scrollbar</li>
<li>No tabs/tab bar</li>
</ul>
<p>I really hope you can update this with the changes they've made because it sure makes Firebird look a whole lot better. Good luck!</p>
<p>Will it be possible to make Aqua-like submit buttons as part of the theme?</p>
