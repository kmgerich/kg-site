<p>Can anyone shed some light on why <a href="misc.html">Phoenix on the Mac</a> compiles just fine but gives a segmentation fault when I try to run the phoenix-bin file? I used the mozilla-bin file from a previous build of Mozilla in place of the bad phoenix-bin and to my surprise it seems to work. This probably causes problems that I haven’t run across yet.</p>

<p>You must have figured it out because I'm using your build of Phoenix to enter this message.</p>
<p>Nice job!!!</p>

<p>Actually no. The build of Phoenix uses the Mozilla binary renamed to 'phoenix-bin'. Why this works I have no idea!</p>

<p>Considered updating?  Apparently new Mozilla source is out today...there are a few small glitches, if I knew C at all I'd try to help, but I am but a poor PERL coding soul. :P</p>

<p>I am currious how you got it to build at all.  And if it built ok, how did it run?  wouldnt you need Xwindows or to create a Cocoa wrapper or something?  I am by anymeans an accomplished C++ developer, just a hobyist.  I know you did it, cause it does work!</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Phoenix is based on Mozilla which is a Carbon front end with a Unix back end. The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/mac.html" rel="nofollow ugc">build instructions are here</a>. You have to pull the source and build Mozilla regularly. Then update your .mozconfig file with as in <a href="http://www.sitemason.com/page/eCIDQc" rel="nofollow ugc">this page</a> (without the last xft line). That'll build Phoenix. But the phoenix-bin will be corrupt somehow. You can use the phoenix-bin from my build or use a mozilla-bin file and rename it to phoenix-bin.</p>

<p>Could it have to do with the optimization line (second to last)?</p>
<p>i686 typically has to do with optimization for Pentium 2, 3, or 4 (I'm not sure where the boundry between i586 and i686 is). Optimizing something for a PC won't help it to run on a Mac.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin</strong> on 2003-03-29 09:53:57</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ah, well I didn't use the i686 line either. This is the .mozconfig I used.</p>
<p>export MOZ_PHOENIX=1
mk_add_options MOZ_PHOENIX=1
ac_add_options --disable-tests
ac_add_options --enable-crypto
ac_add_options --disable-mailnews
ac_add_options --disable-jsd
ac_add_options --disable-composer

ac_add_options --disable-debug
ac_add_options --enable-optimize=-O2
ac_add_options --enable-strip
ac_add_options --enable-extensions=cookie,xmlextras,typeaheadfind,wallet</p>
<p>I've made a build recently and phoenix-bin still crashes unless I replace it with an earlier version.</p>
