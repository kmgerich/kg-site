<p>I’ve come to the conclusion that I have no life. Thankfully I have access to a large selection of products designed to solve this complex problem. Most of these solutions are “digital” in nature.</p>
<p>Apple Computer’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife suite of products</a> helps me effortlessly manage my “digital lifestyle”. AT&amp;T’s <a href="http://www.mlife.com">mLife</a> let’s me be mobile on my own terms. Their advertisement tells me that “<a href="http://www.wirelessnewsfactor.com/perl/story/16150.html">we are meant to lead a truly wireless life</a>“. They promise me “more minutes than ever before”. I’m not quite sure what that means but it sure sounds exciting! Sign me up!</p>
<p>Of course these products would be meaningless without a support system to guide my transition to digital Nirvana. Luckily my good friends at <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com">T-Mobile</a> prompt me to “get more out of life”. And thanks to interventions by the kind folks at Verizon Wireless, I’m making <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/progress/">progress every day</a>.</p>
