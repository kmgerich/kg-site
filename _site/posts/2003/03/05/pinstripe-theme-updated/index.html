<p>I’ve made some minor tweaks to the <a href="/pinstripe/pinstripe.html">Pinstripe Theme</a> to bring it up to date with Mozilla 1.3. If you have any questions you can leave a comment below or send me an <a href="mailto:webmail@kmgerich.com">email</a>.</p>

<p>Can't install your 3/5 build on the current Mozilla Nightly.  Upon clicking install, get error message that says I must use OS X to install....</p>

<p>I assume you are using OS X. You haven't modified your User Agent id, have you? I have a little Javascript that detects the string &quot;Mac OS X&quot; to discourage Linux and Windows users from installing Pinstripe. If you haven't changed your user agent, let me know.</p>

<p>Worked fine for me. Very nice, tasteful tweaks, Kevin!</p>

<p>Nice job.</p>
<p>I like the download progress indicator on the tab very much (vs classic theme)</p>
<p>any planning (is it possible?) on the look of progress bar in download manager window?</p>
<p>Thx.</p>

<p>Yep, it was a modified userid.  Fixed that and pinstripe installed just fine.</p>
<p>Looks great.  Thanks!</p>

<p>Is it just me or is the tab in the latest theme doesn't get the focus set? I am using the latest nightly from 3/14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kevin</strong> on 2003-03-14 07:34:48</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alex, I saw that too. I think that's a bug in the latest nightly build. We should expect some strangeness in the nightly builds for a while because I expect that some of the new code for version 1.4 is landing and will cause instability. A good method to know if a bug you see is Pinstripe related or Mozilla related is to switch to Classic and see if the bug still exists. If not, it's probably a problem with Pinstripe.</p>

<p><strong>Alex</strong> on 2003-03-14 23:28:06</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Understood. Here is another bug. The bookmark from the bookmark bar appears to be blank when in 'focus', i.e. mouse over. This does not happen when in Modern theme.</p>

<p>FYI, <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=197107" rel="nofollow ugc">here's the bug report that covers both issues</a>.</p>

<p>Just an opinion - but I'm not a fan of having the progress indicator included in each tab. I'd rather have one overall one, that spins in relation to the tab currently in focus.</p>
<p>I open a bookmark group every morning with a dozen tabs in them, and the 12 twirling indicators are just waay too much for me (maybe because I've yet to have a coffee!).</p>
<p>Also, the font used in the email client for account/folder pane and the email list (as shown in the screenshots) I find just a bit blocky. Perhaps a Mac font - LucidaGrande might be better?</p>
<p>I find the &quot;appearance font&quot; settings in moz don't effect the email client here.</p>
<p>In ANY case - love the theme, love mozilla.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Simon</p>

<p>Simon, thanks for the comments. The font for email is the system font bumped up a bit bigger than the default. If your system font is Lucida Grande, then that's what you should see. I took a hint from Mail.app on the font size and I think it works well. Do you have your system fonts set at something other than the Mac OS X default? If you could <a>send me a screenshot</a>, that would be very helpful. Thanks!</p>
<p>Kevin</p>

<p><strong>Simon</strong> on 2003-03-19 20:23:47</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahhhh -</p>
<p>Sorry, it is Lucida Grande, just a point size higher - gotcha.</p>
<p>Heres my system:</p>
<p>OSX
System Font: Lucida Grande, 11pt
Fixed pitch font: Monaco, 10pt
Application Font: LucidaGrande, 11pt.
(fonts as seen through tinker tool)</p>
<p>Moz
Proportional: Serif 11px
Serif: Lucida Grande
Sans-serif Lucida Grande</p>
<p>so with these settings, I can see the Moz account folder pane and email list is Lucida Grande 12px.</p>
<p>Comparing it to Mail.app - yep, I can see that its the same size as the mailbox panel. But their mailbox panel is (making assumptions here) is most likely for intro users(?), who may have a limited number of accounts and sub folders.</p>
<p>I keep track of 5 email accounts, each with 2-3 levels of folders and mail storage. Hence my  desire to make the view &quot;lean and mean&quot; (and as small as possible).</p>
<p>some other points - Even though Mail.app mailbox font is 12px, the email message browse looks to be 11px.</p>
<p>and the moz preferences category tree-view looks to be 11px.</p>
<p>Phew!!!!!!</p>
<p>Sorry if that got a bit long winded. Its a great theme - I'm sure I could probably open it up and modify the CSS myself (am tempted to try this ..) because I fully appreciate you can't please everyone!</p>
<p>Again - as I said, great theme, great browser. Keep up the good work!</p>
<p>Cheers,
Simon</p>

<p><strong>Kevin</strong> on 2003-03-19 22:02:05</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simon, add this bit of CSS to the userChrome.css file (in your ~/Library/Mozilla/{profile name}/xxxxxxxx.slt/chrome folder)</p>
<p>treechildren:-moz-tree-cell-text {
font-size: 100% !important;
}</p>
<p>That should work. I haven't tested it so it may effect other parts of the theme but I don't think so because Mail is the only place I make the font size 110%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Simon</strong> on 2003-03-22 22:55:56</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kevin you're a legend!!</p>
<p>Thats great - works a treat. Now I can have my cake and eat it too ...</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Cheers,

<p>Hello, your skin is great. Just one thing. I have found a add-on from the internet you may want to add on to your Skin. It is a Home Button for the Navigation bar, It's a great add-on and would be great if you made it appliable on your skin. Here is a link: http://home.no.net/trihand/mozilla/home/en/</p>
<p>Thank You for your time..
