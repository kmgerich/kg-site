<p>For some reason I’ve never met an aggregator that I like. I don’t like to paw through large lists of headlines and bounce between a reader and a web browser. My ultimate aggregator would help me classify by subjects, feeds, headlines and weight them based on my reading habits. Does something like this exist for Mac OS X?</p>
<p>I’ve noticed there are a handful of RSS reader extensions for Mozilla. Does anyone have experience with them?</p>

<p>I don't think it does - yet. Brent has been talking about some cool ideas along those lines for NNW though.</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,  Have you given QuikView a try?  Cross-platform, cross-browser friendly and makes for a great bookmark server too.  http://quikonnex.com/channel/quikview/home4success</p>

<p>I've been playing with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk" rel="nofollow ugc">Amphetadesk</a>, which is nice when you combine it with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines" rel="nofollow ugc">AmphetaOutlines</a>. AphetaOutlines records your clicks and moves the frequently read stuff to the top. Very nice. Still, I'm not sure if I can get used to reading news this way. I wonder if there is an XUL version of AmphetaOutlines. Hmm :)</p>

<p>Kevin,</p>
<p>I use the RSS Reader extension for Mozilla Firefox, and I love it.  It's very handy, and it's nice to have the posts rendered in a Gecko engine instead of  by a generic rss reader.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://fls.moo.jp/moz/rssreader.html" rel="nofollow ugc">RSS Reader Panel</a> is a very cool addition to Firefox. But it downloads newsfeeds one at a time as I click on them. AmphetaDesk and NetNewsWire download all your subscribed feeds at once which makes skimming much easier.</p>

<p>Omniweb 5 beta has RSS support. Not sure how good it is though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Kevin</strong> on 2004-02-22 21:44:30</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I was looking at Omniweb's RSS support the other day. They integrate it into the Bookmarks Manager. It's a nice try, but the functionality is pretty bare bones.</p>
<p>and GSF, FeedDemon is for Windows. I'm on a Mac :)</p>

<p>Try <a href="http://www.bloglines.com" rel="nofollow ugc">Bloglines</a>  It's web-based so you can read from where ever you are.</p>

<p>I've read good things about <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/" rel="nofollow ugc">NetNewsWire</a>. It's a rss reader for OS X. The full version costs $39.95, but there's a lite version that's freeware and has most of the functionality.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ranchero.com/downloads/NetNewsWireLite1.0.8.dmg.gz" rel="nofollow ugc"> lite version of NetNewsWire is buried behind a lot a scrolling on their page.  Otherwise, it is the least annoying one so far.  It even aggregrates! </a></p>

<p>Have you tried <a href="http://www.thinkmac.co.uk/newsmac/" rel="nofollow ugc">NewsMac</a> yet?</p>

<p>I'm unfortunately not aware of any Mac readers that appraoch FeedDemon.</p>
<p>NNW is OK but unrefined and expensive. The free version doesn't have the three side-by-side panels. Channels are displayed in a tree which is clunky.</p>
<p>Shrook's synching is cool but the client is terrible. No dates. 4 panels instead of the better 3. Distracting stars. Headlines-only in summary panel.</p>
<p>NewsMac is polished but has way too much feed organization to the detriment of feed reading.</p>
<p>Web-based services are horribly inefficent.</p>
<p>It would be terrific if someone would &quot;port&quot; FeedDemon to MacOS.</p>

<p>You could try <a href="http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/BottomFeeder/" rel="nofollow ugc">BottomFeeder</a>, cross platform Smalltalk based RSS reader.  Has a nice bundle for OS/X.</p>
