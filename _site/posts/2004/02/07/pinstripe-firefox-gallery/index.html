<p>These theme makes firebird more aqua looking than camino, it's so elegant, ive been using it since the firstnightlies it is a great work... i was wondering if your you are going to develop a mozilla one??</p>
<p>The only thing thats missing from totally turning me to FB its that there is no close button per tab ala Safari...</p>

Thanks again for your Pinstripe themes... As a Mozilla suite fan, I'm waiting (for a long time now !!! :)) your version for 1.6 and next... firebird is nice, but a little bit too much rough on mac for the moment... And the suite app. is almost perfect !!!

<p>You're right rgw. Here's the <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206649" rel="nofollow ugc">bug report</a> that covers it. This is one of the rough spots which will hopefully be smoothed out by Firebird 1.0</p>

<p>This one is for Mario - the guy who posted first - you can have close buttons for each tab in Fire[bird|fox]. You just have to install the 'Tabbrowser' extension - and it is in there amongst the many other cool options this gives ...</p>

<p>Great work, this theme is awesome!!</p>
<p>The only thing I would object to is the scissor icon you chose for &quot;cut&quot; button, which is visually unrelated with &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;paste&quot; ones - please don't blame me for addressing such a trivial point... :-)</p>
<p>Slighty off-topic, my 2 cents on the issue of  &quot;Close tab&quot; button location addressed by Mario: although Apple's choice brings the benefit of letting you close backgrounded tabs quickly, I think that from an UI standpoint Mozilla's solution is preferable because enhances spatial consistency.</p>

<p>I've been using firebird 0.8, err -fox, since the january nightlies and like it better than Safari. It's rock solid and fast and renders almost everything you throw at it. And with Firefox-pinstripe a great browser got great looks! I love it. Lean and mean ;-) Thanks for getting all the icons done so well. I'm still amazed by the robustness of firefox and pinstripe. (I like firefox-pinstripe better than the old mozilla-pinstripe 2.0.) Thanks Kevin!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Riccardo: what do you mean by &quot;enhances spatial consistency&quot;? I honestly can't figure out what that's supposed to mean. To me, having a single &quot;close current tab&quot; button makes about as much sense as having a single &quot;close current window&quot; button in the corner of my screen.</p>
<p>One of the main things preventing me from switching to Firefox is the clunkiness of the tabs compared to Galeon. Every time a new version comes out I give it another chance. I've also tried using &quot;Tabbrowser extensions&quot;, but Galeon still has significantly better tabbed browsing support, IMHO. Galeon lets me have:</p>
<ul><li> tabs at the bottom (makes mores sense to me for some reason). Tabbrowser extensions lets you turn this on, but the tabs still render like they're supposed to be on the top. :-Q
</li><li>close buttons on the tabs. Again, Tabbrowser extensions lets you turn this on, but the close buttons it uses are ENORMOUS. The close buttons on my Firefox tabs are about 1/3 the size of an entire tab in Galeon.
</li><li>closing the last tab closes the window. This seems like the most obvious thing, but I can't get this in Firefox even with Tabbrowser extensions!
</li><li>can drag tabs off of a window. If I want a tab to be in its own window in Galeon I can just drag it off.
</li><li>Galeon seems to be a lot smarter about where it opens tabs. It also remembers which tabs I've looked at, and which I haven't, and color codes them.
</li><li>sensible options without having to install a separate extension that pops up big ugly dialogs and makes my browser unstable (I get a lot more crashes and bizarre rendering artifacts when Tabbrowser extensions is installed)
</li></ul>

<p>Hey, I installed Firefox on a OS X 10.1 machine I had lying around. However, I noticed that the default theme is different from the one show in the screen shots at the top of this page. Unlike the screen shot pics, my Firefox doesn't have that new smoothe 10.3 Panther look to it. I still see the horizonal lines all over the interface. Is this normal? Is the Firefox/Pinstripe theme supposed to look different depending on the OS it's running on?</p>
<p>Thanks (appleweek@hotmail.com)</p>

<p>I have my PC running the OSX Aqua theme - so much nicer!</p>

<p><strong>Riccardo</strong> on 2004-02-11 12:15:36</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laurence, I was referring to a &quot;good rule&quot; in interface design, which says that buttons and controls should always, as far as possible, keep the very same position on screen. This is intended to help users automate the mental process required to target the active area of the control (&quot;muscle memory&quot;), thus letting them gain confidence and efficency when operating the interface. In general, Mozilla close tab button keeps the very same relative position in the browser's windows. Speaking of my personal habits, I also find this very comfortable when I'm on Windows OSes: I'm used to keep all windows maximized to full screen, and in this special case, the close tab button maintain the same absolute position on screen. I istintictively konw that I have to move to the upper left side of the screen to hit the button - and, by the way, I also have not to worry about bringing another tab to the front if I &quot;mistarget&quot; the button's active area.</p>
<p>Anyway, I can admit that those could not be such strong points when it comes to different users' behaviors, and when compared to other advantages carried by having close buttons on each tab.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure, really, if &quot;spatial consistency&quot; is the right term for this thing - I'm italian and my english is a bit rough, beg your pardon :-)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>PS: sorry for long posting on a collateral issue.</p>

<p><strong>Matt</strong> on 2004-02-14 18:57:30</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop asking for Windows ports.  This isn't as simple as you may imagine.  Yes, most themes work fine on any OS version of Firefox, but Pinstripe isn't like most themes.</p>
<p>Pinstripe actually makes use of the GUI libraries on OSX to make it look that way.  There's no way to simply port these libraries to Windows, so Pinstripe can't simply be ported to Windows.  Yes, someone could make a theme that looks nearly identical to Pinstripe, but it's not really reasonable to ask this guy to maintain two themes that look the same just so people on Windows can use this.</p>
<p>If you really want this look you have a couple options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write your own theme that looks like this</li>
<li>Get one of the theme programs for Windows (not a complete solution, but similar)</li>
<li>Get a Mac.  If you like the look so much, why not actually get a Mac and forget about Windows.</li>

^^ A port that's been found. About as close are you are going to get. Be warned, it can cause some serious damage if not installed properly: Close FireFox, backup the old classic.jar file in 'Mozilla FireFox/chrome' and replace it with this. Some extensions may cause serious issues with this theme.</p>

<p>Just got Firefox (what an improvement from 0.7!) &amp; I do like the new version of Pinstripe very much.  Still, sometimes one wants buttons with pretty colors too!  Any chance you might port the last version of Pinstripe over for Firefox as an alternate for us to use?  Or perhaps color this one in with colors to match the buttons you used in the Bookmark manager?  I think you were going for the Apple plastic button look, which is cool, but as I said, sometimes one wants pretty colors!</p>
<p>Thanks for all the work you've put into your themes!</p>

<p>This theme is absolutely stunning.  I love it.</p>
<p>Regarding the Windows port...
(The Windows port [classic.jar above] has some problems with the Privacy and Advanced sections under Options.  The [+] boxes are missing.  And the 'Save All Files to Folder' dropbox under the Downloads section under Options is a bit large on the height side.  And the navigation toolbar has a bit too much space above and below the buttons.  But don't get me wrong.  It's a GREAT port, and I appreciate all the work put into it.)</p>

<p>My apologies, I didn't intend to take a &quot;shot&quot; at anyone. I'm a graphic designer and I take it personally when I read anything remotely critical of my own work. I do not want my comments to be misconstrued in such a way.</p>
<p>To clarify, one of the reasons I use Firefox (and a Mac platform) is because the unobtrusive interface doesn't compete with the colors in the work I create for the Web. When I'm designing and testing a site, I am able to evaluate my color scheme on a neutral background with the Pinstripe theme.</p>
<p>While the icons of the new default theme aren't as screaming as a bright blue Microsoft toolbar, they're still rather large and stylized, which competes with some websites. I hope to stay the 0.8 until more themes are made available, or the creator of this beautiful, minimalistic theme makes the version with small gray buttons available as a download for a later version.</p>
<p>It has been established that the theme will not be available for Windows, but is it possible that it will be available for the launch of Firefox 1.0?</p>

<p>Nice theme. I hope it will become the default theme for Linux version of Thunderbird mail client as well.</p>

<p>For some reason, my Firefox 1.0 toolbar shows different icons for previous, next, reload, stop and home. All the other parts seem to be from Pinstripe except those icons in the toolbar.</p>
<p>Anybody knows what could be wrong?</p>
