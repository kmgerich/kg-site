Mac users will also appreciate the new mail notification badge in the dock. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/download.html">Try it out</a>!

<p>I'm using the vertical view all the time now. Superb job on the pinstripe theme - its even better than Firefox!</p>

<p>Thanks Jon. One of the things Stephen and I found when we dove into the Thunderbird theme is that there are a lot more bits. Firefox's interface is simple by comparison. We were both kind of burnt out on the icons after going back and forth on them for months.</p>

<p>Nearly two months and nothing on the thread lines? Does ANYONE know how to make those lines appear in TB pinstripe? Some users at Mozillazine suggested some userchrome modifications but those did nothing. Thanks again...</p>
