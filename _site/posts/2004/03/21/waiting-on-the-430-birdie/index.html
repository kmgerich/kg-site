<p>The birds have been returning to New England over the past month. From my porch I can see jays, crows, robins, cardinals, and I can hear the occasional woodpecker. Over the past few years, in late March or early April, a single bird, an american robin I think, sits in a tree outside our window and sings its little lungs out in the early morning. It’s a strange thing to hear because there is almost no other bird chatter at that time. My girlfriend and I call this the “4:30 birdie”. Spring may have sprung, but the season won’t have truly changed until the 4:30 birdie arrives.</p>

<p>Let me know when the FTB arrives. Lots of birds here in England and lots of watchers as well.</p>
<p>But have not heard any that compare with the FTB.</p>

<p>If the song is really complicated, long, and repetitive, it might be a mockingbird.</p>
<p>They're neat. I love watching one chase after a much larger crow, yelling at it and even touching the crow when it can.</p>
